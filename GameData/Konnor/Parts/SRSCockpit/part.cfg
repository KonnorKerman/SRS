    description = Originally designed for business jets and other aircraft of a similar role, this cockpit had to be repurposed due to lack of demand, as most potential customers were suddenly more interested in space tourism than in business trips. Now, rebranded as "Superficially Reingineered for Space" (SRS) Business cockpit, this pod brings business-class comfort levels to your space trips!

    description = The Special Orbital/Atmospheric Reconnaisance project was III's first venture into military applications, but as often happens with large governmental contracts, the project (and the spaceplane in question, too) did not take off (largely because of executive meddling). Nevertheless, this cockpit was finished (the only part of the project to see production), and is now offered to civilian space agencies at a discount price!
